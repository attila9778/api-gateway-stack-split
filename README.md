# Breaking up AWS API Gateway Resources into NestedStacks

Welcome! This is a small AWS CDK (Python) project that demonstrates how to overcome the resource limit of an API Gateway in a single CloudFormation stack by breaking it up into NestedStacks and having a non-basic default integration.

This repository complements my first technical blog post, where I share the story behind this setup, the problems I faced, and how I resolved them using CDK best practices and some workarounds.

## üß† Motivation

Long ago, I was working on an internal project that used AWS API Gateway extensively. At some point, we hit the **CloudFormation stack resource limit** due to the large number of endpoints.

The official [AWS CDK documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.aws_apigateway-readme.html#breaking-up-methods-and-resources-across-stacks) briefly covers how to split API Gateway resources across stacks using **NestedStacks**. However, in practice, if we go with a solution closer to real-world application, I ran into several issues and edge cases not mentioned there.

This repo demonstrates how I tackled those challenges.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Concepts & Problems Solved

- **Default integration propagation**  
    CDK automatically propagates `default_integration` across stacks, which can cause unexpected behavior. I show how to handle it explicitly.

- **Passing RestApi between stacks**  
    To split resources, I needed to pass the `RestApi` object and certain props across stacks to maintain consistent deployment behavior.

- **Policy size overflow in Lambda integrations**  
    Adding too many endpoints caused IAM policy size to exceed limits. I demonstrate how using **custom Lambda integrations** helps reduce policy size.

- **Manual logical ID for Deployment**  
    Without a logical ID change, CDK might skip creating a new deployment. I used:
    ```python
    deployment.add_to_logical_id(str(datetime.now()))
    ```

- **Dependency handling between stacks**
    Correct Deployment and Stage setup required manually setting:
    ```python
    deployment.node.add_dependency(resource_stack)
    ```

- **Understanding error messages**
    One tricky error involved:
    ```bash
    The root method 'ANY' is required
    ```
    I explain what it means and how to fix it.

## üß™ How to Run
  
1. Make sure you have Python and AWS CDK installed.
2. Install requirements:
    ```python
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Deploy:
    ```bash
    cdk deploy
    ```
